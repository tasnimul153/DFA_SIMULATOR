# DFA Simulator: Interactive Deterministic Finite Automaton Visualization

## Overview
The DFA Simulator is an interactive tool built with JavaScript to offer a dynamic visualization of Deterministic Finite Automatons. Aimed at providing users with a tangible representation of state transitions, this simulator allows the real-time addition of nodes and connections, with immediate feedback mechanisms.

## Problem Statement
Understanding DFAs can be abstract and challenging. By offering an interactive visualization, the DFA Simulator bridges the gap between abstract concepts and tangible understanding. This tool addresses the need for a hands-on approach to learning, understanding, and testing DFAs.

## Core Features
1. **Dynamic Visualization**: Utilizes GoJS for an engaging and dynamic graphical representation of DFA states and transitions.
2. **User Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on connection successes or errors, enhancing user understanding and experience.
3. **Interactive UI**: Developed with jQuery to facilitate easy creation of DFA states, transition definitions, and testing of input strings.
4. **Efficient Validation**: Efficiently validates DFA configurations and provides intuitive visual feedback on the validity of input strings.

## Technical Details
- **GoJS Integration**: This powerful library is at the core of our visualization mechanism, offering interactive diagrams with zoom, overview, and other features.
- **jQuery Enhancements**: The tool benefits from jQuery to deliver a more responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **MediaPipe Holistic**: Utilized for recognizing holistic landmarks, crucial for the accurate representation and tracking of nodes.
- **Data Collection & Processing**: Employs time series data capturing for state transitions, ensuring accurate DFA simulations.

## Future Scope
The simulator lays the foundation for further development, potentially integrating more advanced automaton types, and offering a platform for educational purposes in computer science curricula.
